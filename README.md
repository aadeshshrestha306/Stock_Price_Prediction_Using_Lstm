# Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_Lstm

A Deep Learning model built to predict the stock price for a given company(TESLA Inc) using Tensorflow, Keras API and Scikit-Learn. Data obtained using the AlphaVantage API.

The model is based on a LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) algorithm a type of RNN(Recurrent Neural Network).

The data trained dates back to 20 years ago till date(2023/12/10).

### Errors and Disturbances

The final chart may show a close prediction to actual values but stock prices are dependent on multiple external factors. This is one of my first time training a RNN model.

Any help and suggestion is appreciated.
