# Stock_Price_Prediction_Using_Lstm

A Deep Learning model built to predict the stock price for a given company(TESLA Inc) using Tensorflow, Keras API and Scikit-Learn. Data obtained using the AlphaVantage API.

The model is based on a LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) algorithm a type of RNN(Recurrent Neural Network).

Currently the model has access to data dating back only 100 days from today and predicts the value of last 20 days of stock prices with validation.
